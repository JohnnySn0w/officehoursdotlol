  <p>We're at The Lido on broadway most weeks.</p>

    season if you've got a suggestion.

    Look for the table with the giant rubber duck &#x1F986; &#x1F986; &#x1F986;
    <p>His name is Max.</p>
    <p>Sometimes he glows like a beacon in an inky black sea.</p>
    <p>Sometimes he wears sunglasses inside.</p>
    <p>Sometimes he steals people's hats.</p>
    <p>He's honestly a menace to society.</p>
